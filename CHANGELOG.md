## [0.10.1] — 2026-05-12

### Security

- **F-01 (CWE-770, P2/medium)** — Multipart uploads: added configurable size limits (`maxMultipartPartSize`, `maxMultipartBodySize`) to `Configuration` and `OpenAI.init`. Requests exceeding these limits now throw `OpenAIError.bufferOverflow` *before* allocation rather than risking unbounded memory growth at the trust boundary in server-side adopters. Defaults (512 MB part / 1 GB body) track OpenAI's server-side limits; opt out with `Int.max`. The internal encoder was also refactored to eliminate one redundant full-body copy (peak memory reduced from ~3× to ~2× payload). Note: uploads are still buffered eagerly in `Data`; true streaming via `URLRequest.httpBodyStream` is deferred to a future release. **iOS/watchOS adopters should set explicit lower limits** appropriate to their process heap.
- **F-02 (CWE-400, P3/low)** — Server-Sent Events parser: unified Darwin and Linux iterators into a single byte-by-byte loop. The 10 MB line-size cap now fires *before* string materialization on both platforms (previously, Darwin's `AsyncLineSequence`-based path materialized the full `String` line first). EOF-flush behavior preserved on the unified path so unterminated final SSE lines are still processed.
- **F-03 (CWE-494, P3/low)** — CI: Linux job container pinned to immutable Docker digest (`swift:6.0@sha256:efe796...6a49`) to prevent supply-chain attacks via Docker Hub tag mutation. Refresh procedure documented inline in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Recommended follow-up: add Dependabot Docker ecosystem for automated digest tracking.

### Changed

- `MultipartFormData.encode()` (internal) is now `encode(maxPartSize:maxBodySize:) throws -> Data`. No public API impact — `MultipartFormData` is `internal`.
- `ServerSentEvents` iterator: non-`DecodingError` exceptions thrown by `JSONDecoder.decode` are now wrapped uniformly as `OpenAIError.decodingError` (was: only `DecodingError` was wrapped, other errors propagated raw).

### Fixed

- `SDK.version` constant synced to `"0.10.1"` (was stale at `"0.8.0"`, never bumped past v0.8.0 despite v0.9.x and v0.10.0 tags). Affects only the `User-Agent` string sent on requests.

### Audit

- L6 deferred audit closure: line-by-line review of all custom `Codable` implementations under `Sources/SwiftOpenAI/Types/Chat/` and `Sources/SwiftOpenAI/Types/Responses/` (12 files, 7 with custom codecs). All polymorphic decoders use safe `default: .other(value)` fallback or explicit `throw`. No medium-or-higher findings. Three low-correctness observations noted but below the suppression bar established in the original Codex scan.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Insecure local/LAN endpoint opt-in** — `Configuration.allowInsecureRequests` enables plain `http` / `ws` connections for local development and self-hosted servers
- `isLocalOrLAN(host:)` host classifier — permits loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`), `.local` hostnames, and RFC 1918 private IPv4 ranges (`10.x`, `172.16–31.x`, `192.168.x`)
- `validateURL(_:allowInsecure:)` replaces the previous debug-only assertion with consistent enforcement across debug and release builds
- WebSocket URL derivation (`http → ws`, `https → wss`) now respects the insecure-requests flag
- `OpenAI(apiKey:baseURL:allowInsecureRequests:)` initializer propagates the opt-in through to configuration
- Extensive unit tests for host classification, URL validation, client init with insecure flag, and WebSocket scheme conversion

### Changed
- URL security validation is now enforced in all build configurations (previously debug-only `assertionFailure`)
- Examples and README updated with `allowInsecureRequests` usage and App Transport Security (ATS) guidance

## [0.7.0] — 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Azure AI Foundry support** — `OpenAI.azureFoundry()` factory methods for Azure AI Foundry project endpoints with Entra ID (OAuth 2.0 client credentials) authentication
- `TokenProvider` protocol for dynamic authentication with automatic token refresh
- `EntraIDTokenProvider` actor — obtains and caches Azure Entra ID tokens via OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow (~1 hour lifetime, auto-refreshes 5 min before expiry)
- `StaticTokenProvider` — for pre-obtained tokens from external sources (CLI, backend)
- `OpenAI.azure(resourceName:apiKey:)` factory for Azure OpenAI v1 GA API with `api-key` header auth
- `OpenAI.azureFoundry(endpoint:tenantId:clientId:clientSecret:)` factory for full Entra ID auth
- `OpenAI.azureFoundry(endpoint:token:)` factory for pre-obtained token auth
- `Configuration.defaultQueryItems` — query items appended to every request (used for `api-version`)
- `Configuration.apiKeyHeaderName` — custom API key header name (e.g., `"api-key"` for Azure)
- Interactive streaming chat console in ExampleApp (`swift run ExampleApp chat`) — supports both API key and Foundry backends with auto-detection of Conversations API availability
- 19 new unit tests for Azure configuration, initializers, token provider, and query merge
- Azure Foundry live tests in ExampleApp (token auth, conversations CRUD, responses with conversation)

### Changed
- Comprehensive Azure documentation in README with feature comparison table, Entra ID setup guide, and Conversations API usage with Foundry project endpoints

### Fixed
- `EntraIDTokenProvider.percentEncode()` now uses RFC 3986 unreserved character set for form-urlencoded body encoding — prevents silent credential corruption when client secrets contain `&`, `=`, or `+`

## [0.6.1] — 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- Add 10 MB buffer limit on streaming error response body — prevents unbounded memory accumulation from malicious/misconfigured servers

## [0.6.0] — 2026-02-25

### Added
- Connection pre-warming via `OpenAI.warmConnection()` — eliminates TCP/TLS handshake latency on first request
- WebSocket keepalive pings in `WebSocketClient` — prevents idle connection drops in Realtime/ResponsesWebSocket sessions
- Explicit connect timeout cap (`timeoutIntervalForResource` capped at 1200s)

### Changed
- **SSE parsing**: Replaced byte-by-byte iteration with line-based processing (`AsyncLineSequence`) on Apple platforms — reduces async suspension overhead by 100-300x per SSE event
- **URL construction**: Cached `URLComponents` and pre-built common headers in `HTTPClient.init` — eliminates per-request URL re-parsing
- **MultipartFormData**: Uses `ContiguousArray<UInt8>` builder instead of intermediate `Data` allocations — 30-50% fewer allocations during form encoding
- **JSON decode**: Added explicit `CodingKeys` to SSE hot-path types (`ResponseStreamEvent`, `ChatCompletionChunk`, `ChatCompletion`, etc.) — eliminates runtime `convertFromSnakeCase` key transformation
- **Retry delay**: Backoff capped at 8s (matching Python SDK `MAX_RETRY_DELAY`); `Retry-After` header respected up to 120s

### Fixed
- SSE buffer overflow check now guards per-line size (not cumulative stream length) — prevents false truncation on large streaming responses (64K+ tokens)

## [0.5.0] — 2026-02-25

### Added
- Retry with exponential backoff for 429/5xx responses (configurable `maxRetries`, `retryDelay`)
- Auto-pagination via `AutoPaginatingSequence` AsyncSequence on `CursorPage`
- `SDK.version` and `SDK.userAgent` centralized constants
- `ResponseStreamEvent` fields: `itemId`, `text`, `arguments`, `name`, `callId`, `sequenceNumber`
- `OpenAI.shutdown()` for proper URLSession cleanup
- `ChatCompletionMessage` Decodable conformance (now fully Codable)
- Public memberwise initializers on `ChatCompletion` and `Response` types
- `TruncationStrategy` and `ServiceTier` enums with `other(String)` fallback
- SSE buffer size limit (10 MB) and WebSocket `maximumMessageSize`
- Audio MIME type inference from filename extension
- SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md
- Build caching in CI; Linux validation in release workflow

### Fixed
- `ConversationItem.callId` always decoded as nil due to CodingKeys conflict
- `ResponsesWebSocket` `isInFlight` permanently stuck on send failure
- URLSession resource leaks in `HTTPClient` and `RealtimeConnection`
- CRLF header injection via `organization`, `project`, and `mimeType` values
- Realtime URL not using `URLComponents` (model name left unencoded)
- Missing `OpenAI-Beta: realtime=v1` header on Realtime connections
- `Content-Type` header incorrectly set on GET/DELETE requests
- `ChatCompletions.createStream` missing 11 parameters vs `create`

### Security
- Sanitized `organization`, `project`, and `mimeType` headers against CRLF injection
- HTTPS enforcement promoted from DEBUG-only to always-on
- Linux security defaults (cookies and cache disabled)
- GitHub Actions workflow steps pinned to commit SHAs
- Added `.env`/`.key` patterns to `.gitignore`
